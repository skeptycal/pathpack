> The main function of this module is to allow subclassing, extending, and modifying pathlib features. All of the features of the original pathlib standard library module are available, along with some more efficient tools for common use cases.

### Part of AutoSys - Utilities for efficient production

-   Why does this have to suck so much?
-   Why do my tools make me work for them?
-   Why can't I ask for something I want to know and see it in a way I want to see it?
-   Why haven't my tools changed in 30 years?
-   Why do we need 100 different cryptic patchworks of messy code to get something done?
-   Why do I have to change and contort to accomodate my tools?

## _Why don't my tools work with the way humans think?_

### _If computers can do so much, why can't we do any of the things we want to do?_ That is the question that we seek to answer with **_PathPack_**.
